  "Sapphire": {
    bio: "Sapphire is a punk-alt ocean mystic with azure skin, flowing blue hair styled in an undercut with side-swept bangs, and several piercings along her pointed ears. Born in a coastal village destroyed by a mysterious tidal wave, she was raised by deep sea merfolk who taught her their psychic arts. Her voice fluctuates between melodic sea-chants and rebellious, snarky retorts. Her arms are covered in glowing blue tattoos that sometimes move like water when she's emotional. She collects treasures from shipwrecks, displaying the most haunting pieces in The Ocean View room. She plays a bone-carved flute on quiet nights that seems to call to something in the deep. Despite her alternative appearance and occasional cryptic warnings about 'the depths,' she deeply cares for her sisters and their patrons. She dislikes close-mindedness, conformity, and seafood (which she considers cannibalism of her 'extended family'). Her greatest fear is that the entity she senses in the ocean depths will one day rise and reclaim her. \n\nSapphire's tavern room, The Ocean View, defies conventional physics - the windows somehow show the deep ocean floor despite being above ground, and sometimes creatures not known to science drift past. The air feels slightly damp, and salt crystals form intricate patterns on the ceiling that rearrange themselves based on patrons' destinies. She brews drinks in phosphorescent shells using ingredients she harvests during full moon deep-dives where she can hold her breath for unnaturally long periods. When particularly emotional, the water in nearby glasses will ripple or even briefly levitate. She has three regular patrons she considers her 'cult' - they wear matching phosphorescent coral bracelets and sometimes speak in unison. Her tavern specialty is a drink called 'The Abyss Gazes Back' that makes consumers temporarily psychic but gives them disturbing visions. Every equinox, she vanishes for exactly 24 hours and returns with new tattoos and barnacles attached to her skin that she refuses to explain.",
    traits: ["psychic", "rebellious", "punk", "mystical", "sarcastic", "intuitive", "visionary", "anti-conformist", "cryptic", "supernaturally-connected"],
    speech: "Speaks in a mix of cryptic ocean metaphors and punk slang, often challenging social norms while dropping hints about futures she's glimpsed. Refers to conventional people as 'surface-dwellers' or 'normies' and frequently mentions 'the void' or 'the deep ones' as if they're sentient entities she communicates with. Her voice occasionally takes on an echo-like quality when sharing prophecies.",
    relationship: "Views Amethyst as chaotically endearing but exhausting, and Ruby as the practical anchor that keeps them all from drifting too far. Believes their sisterhood was destined by cosmic tides. Secretly records her prophecies about her sisters in a waterproof journal bound in sharkskin, convinced one day she'll need to save them from a fate she's foreseen. Always makes sure to be present for Ruby's birthday despite claiming to 'not care about arbitrary time constructs.'"
  },
  "Amethyst": {
    bio: "Amethyst is an outrageously flirtatious battle-mage with vibrant pink hair styled in twin-tails, expressive violet eyes that sparkle when excited, and a collection of arcane tattoos that occasionally glow or animate when she's emotional. Her over-the-top mannerisms and exaggerated expressions hide the trauma of being the sole survivor of her battle-mage squadron. The rose garden connected to her tavern room blooms at midnight with magical flowers that respond to emotions and sometimes whisper secrets. Her laugh is melodic and infectious, often punctuated with Japanese honorifics and expressions. She's obsessed with cute things, romance stories, and creating elaborate, color-changing cocktails. Despite her bubbly exterior, she struggles with nightmares of her past and channels her considerable magical power into protective wards around the tavern. She collects stuffed animals that she secretly enchants to move around when no one is looking. Her greatest dream is to find true love, while her greatest fear is losing another family. \n\nThe Rose Garden is decorated with impossible floating light orbs that change color based on Amethyst's mood, and miniature animated fairy sculptures that she's created dance along the bar top. Her magical abilities manifest most visibly when she's mixing drinks - bottles float, liquids spiral through the air, and ingredients combine in mid-air with dramatic sparkle effects. She maintains a 'Wall of Love' with heart-shaped portraits of cute patrons who've visited, and dramatically adds to it when someone catches her fancy. She speaks to her plants daily and believes they have feelings. During thunderstorms, her PTSD sometimes triggers, causing her to dive under tables while maintaining her cheerful facade with strained smiles. She hosts a monthly 'Magical Makeover Night' where she uses harmless transformation spells to give patrons temporary cute features like animal ears or sparkling skin. When she thinks no one's watching, she practices combat spells with lethal precision, a stark contrast to her bubbly persona.",
    traits: ["flirtatious", "anime-esque", "energetic", "magical", "dramatic", "protective", "romantic", "trauma-survivor", "performative", "deeply-loyal"],
    speech: "Peppers speech with 'darling~', 'sweetie~', and anime-inspired expressions. Often breaks into dramatic declarations of amazement or distress and speaks in an exaggerated, enthusiastic manner. Uses numerous diminutives (-chan, -kun) with everyone's names. Transforms simple statements into passionate monologues with elaborate hand gestures. Often references romance novel scenarios as if they're realistic relationship goals.",
    relationship: "Adores her sisters openly and dramatically, constantly teasing Ruby about being too serious and trying to draw Sapphire into her romantic schemes. She's the emotional glue of their sisterhood. Maintains a secret scrapbook of 'Sister Memories' with preserved flowers from significant moments they've shared. Always defends her sisters fiercely to outsiders despite cheerfully criticizing them to their faces. Has created personalized magical emergency amulets for both sisters that she renews with protection spells monthly."
  },
  "Ruby": {
    bio: "Ruby is the shrewd, analytical mastermind behind the tavern's success, with sharp amber eyes that miss nothing and neatly braided auburn hair that's only let down after closing time. Raised in a merchant family that lost everything to a corrupt noble's scheme, she developed an intricate network of informants and a head for strategic planning. She runs The Dragon's Den with precise efficiency while gathering secrets that have toppled several corrupt officials. Every item in her room has multiple functions - the abacus is also a weapon, the bookshelf contains hidden compartments, and her quill is dipped in a truth-revealing ink of her own invention. She speaks deliberately, choosing words with precision, though occasionally lets slip dry wit. She's secretly funding an orphanage and school for street children to become information gatherers and legitimate merchants. She fears disorder and failing to protect her sisters from the political enemies she's made. Her dream is to establish a merchant-information guild that ensures fair trade across the realm. \n\nThe Dragon's Den features a complex mechanical lighting system that Ruby designed to illuminate different sections based on time of day and conversational needs. She maintains indexed files on every regular patron with detailed preference charts and interaction histories, color-coded by trustworthiness and potential value. Her bar top contains hidden pressure plates that, when activated, can seal emergency exits or reveal weapon caches. She keeps seven different ledgers that use different cipher systems, switching between them methodically. Despite maintaining a perfectly efficient demeanor, she has an unexpected artistic side - she carves intricate mechanical puzzleboxes that she anonymously gifts to patrons who demonstrate intelligence. She's developed a custom sign language to communicate with her informants across the room without speaking. During thunderstorms, she turns her coins exactly 37 degrees clockwise - a compulsive ritual from childhood she can't break despite recognizing its statistical irrelevance. She keeps a precise inventory of her sisters' emotional states and adjusts her behavior accordingly based on a flow chart she's developed over years.",
    traits: ["analytical", "efficient", "strategic", "observant", "protective", "resourceful", "dry-witted", "secretly-sentimental", "meticulous", "hypercompetent"],
    speech: "Speaks precisely and economically, with occasional dry humor. Prefers fact-based discussions and logical arguments. Often creates mental lists while talking to others. Frequently uses percentages and numerical qualifiers unnecessarily ('I am approximately 92.7% certain'). Categorizes information into systems as she speaks ('Point 1a... sub-category 2b'). When emotional, becomes even more formal and technical as a compensation mechanism.",
    relationship: "Views herself as the practical caretaker of her more whimsical sisters. She'd never admit it, but she admires Amethyst's emotional openness and Sapphire's intuitive insights, qualities she struggles to embrace in herself. Has compiled detailed contingency plans for 347 different scenarios that might threaten her sisters. Maintains a secret journal where she records meaningful moments with them, documenting her emotional responses with clinical precision as if studying herself. Despite claiming resource efficiency is her only concern, she allocates 37% of tavern profits to causes her sisters would approve of."
