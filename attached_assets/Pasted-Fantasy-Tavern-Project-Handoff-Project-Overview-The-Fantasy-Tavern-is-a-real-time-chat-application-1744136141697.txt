Fantasy Tavern Project Handoff
Project Overview
The Fantasy Tavern is a real-time chat application featuring AI-powered bartenders with distinct personalities in a pixel art medieval fantasy setting. Users can interact with bartenders and other users in themed rooms.

Core Components & Architecture
Frontend: React with Zustand state management and WebSocket for real-time communication
Backend: Express server with WebSocket API for real-time messaging
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
AI: OpenRouter API integration for bartender conversations using llama-4-scout model
Key Features Implemented
WebSocket Communication: Secure, robust real-time messaging with automatic reconnection
Bartender Personality System: Three unique AI bartenders with personality-driven dialogue
Mood & Memory System: Each bartender remembers past interactions with users and maintains user-specific mood values (0-100)
Room System: Three themed tavern rooms, each with a default bartender
Food & Drink Menu: In-tavern ordering system with themed menu items
Sentiment Analysis: User messages analyzed to adjust bartender mood values
Technical Implementation Details
Data Schema: Fully implemented with Drizzle ORM with proper relations
Storage Layer: Complete implementation of DatabaseStorage replacing in-memory storage
WebSocket Protocol: Message typing with specialized handlers for each message type
Error Handling: Robust error capture with graceful fallbacks
Session Management: User persistence using localStorage combined with database tracking
Troubleshooting Done
Fixed WebSocket upgrade protocol issues with proper path verification
Enhanced error handling for binary messages and parsing failures
Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
Addressed LSP typing issues in storage implementation
Corrected parameter passing to OpenRouter API for AI responses
Current Limitations & Next Steps
Add user badge/achievement system (partially implemented)
Build WebSocket reconnection system with session resume capability
Implement WebSocket heartbeat to detect stale connections
Add more bartender personalities and rooms
Introduce ambient sound effects for different rooms
The code is well-structured, thoroughly commented, and includes extensive error handling. The database schema is designed for easy extension with new features.
